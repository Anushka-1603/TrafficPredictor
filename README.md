# Traffic Prediction

Traffic congestion is rising in cities around the world driven by factors such as growing urban populations, aging infrastructure, poorly synchronized traffic signals and a lack of real-time data. Given the physical and financial limitations around building additional roads, cities must use new strategies and technologies to improve traffic conditions. One key approach is ‘Traffic Prediction’. The task of traffic prediction is to detect traffic conditions for upcoming periods such as next day, week, etc. Utilizing historical traffic data, time-of-day patterns, and other relevant factors, predictive models can anticipate traffic congestion hotspots and enable the timely deployment of resources to mitigate its impact.
